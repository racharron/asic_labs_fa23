Warning-[DBGACC_DBG] Multiple debug options being used
  The debug switches '-debug_access' and '-debug*' are being used together.
  For better performance, consider using only '-debug_access'.


Error-[VERDI_VCS_MM] Possible VERDI_HOME and VCS_HOME mismatch
  The Verdi tab and pli.a cannot be added to the 'vcs' compile command because
  the file '/pli.a' could not be found.
  Please check to make sure VERDI_HOME and VCS_HOME point to installations
  that are either both 32-bits or both 64-bits.
