Q 3a
The output port is named "Out", and it is 16 bits wide.

Q 3b
delay_chain0 has a delay of 669ps, while the entire unit has a delay of 3.02ns.  

Q 3c
Yes.  The instance beginning at line 515 has the expected delay and is connected to the expected instances.

Q 4
The lowest clock period for which the testbench reports correct outputs is 17ns.

Q 6a
The setup view indicates less power draw than the hold view.  This could be due to the V_DD voltage being lower.
It turns out that expected ratio of V_h^2 to V_s^2 is very close to the ratio of the total energy draws.

Q 6b
The static power reports are conservative, overestimating the power draw.  
The estimated switching activity factor is 0.2 * (3.101/3.857 + 2.078/2.591) / 2 = 0.16
